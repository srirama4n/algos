Data Structures in Java
=======================

I've created this repository to practice common data structures using Java.

Linked List Implementation
--------------------------

The linked list implementation is located in the LinkedList directory and contains three relevant classes, along with the accompanying documentation.

The first two classes are LinkedListIterator and Node. The Node class contains the structure for the nodes in the linked list, while the LinkedListIterator class handles keeping track of the current node being operated on in a List.

The LinkedList class contains the data and structure needed for the linked list as well as the operations to be performed on the list, such as inserting, deleting, searching, and printing out the list.

The <code>Main.java</code> file is the main driver for the application, and gives some example usage of the classes. It shows inserting, deleting, searching, and printing from the lists, including inserting a list into another list and retrieving the data.
